    <h1>Hey, I'm Reuben Abraham!</h1>
    <p>I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a>, a fast-growing startup in San Francisco that aims to provide clarity for all of life's financial decisions. I studied Computer Science, Finance, and Management: Entrepreneurship & Innovation at the <b>University of Pennsylvania</b> <em>(Hurrah Hurrah)</em>. I've been lucky enough to have solved a lot of problems I've faced while programming by taking advantage of various web resources, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, and other blogs. Check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a> - it's my attempt to help some of you out in return.
